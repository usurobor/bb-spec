# Embodied Coherence Protocol

**Proof-of-Physical-Work (PoPW) — Live-observed certification for physical achievements.**

## Overview

Embodied Coherence is a protocol that issues non-transferable credentials for physical achievements verified by authorized Certifiers under shared Standards.

### Key Features

- **Proof-of-Physical-Work (PoPW)** — Live-observed, 2-of-2 signed attestations (Prover + Certifier)
- **Body Bound Tokens (BBT)** — Non-transferable SBTs minted on PASS; do not expire (v1)
- **Versioned Standards** — Immutable (standardId, version) definitions with leaderboard eligibility
- **Certifier Network** — Genesis Keys + 3-vouch expansion + revocation (v1 safety valve)
- **$EC Token** — Fee and governance token (other fee assets may be approved)

## Protocol Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Creator** | Registers Standards; earns royalty per PASS mint |
| **Prover** | Attempts; pays fee |
| **Certifier** | Authorized; observes live; co-signs; earns fee per attempt |
| **Genesis Keys** | Initial Certifiers; manage Certifier set in v1 |

---

## How It Works

```
1) Select Standard → 2) Observe Live → 3) Co-sign → 4) On-chain → 5) Leaderboard
```

1. Prover selects **(standardId, version)** and uses a tool matching the spec
2. Prover performs under **live observation** (co-located or video)
3. Prover + Certifier co-sign one attestation (2-of-2)
4. Attestation recorded on-chain
   - **PASS**: mint BBT
   - **NO PASS**: record attempt; no BBT
5. Leaderboards rank **verified PASS** per standard (eligible versions only)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for smart contract development
- Node.js 18+ for frontend

### Build Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
forge build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd contracts
forge test
```

## Trust Model (v1)

PoPW v1 is **permissioned** by design.

**Certifier Authorization**
- **Phase 1 (Genesis):** only Genesis Keys certify
- **Phase 2 (Expansion):** candidate becomes certifier after **3 on-chain vouches**
- **Revocation:** Genesis Keys may revoke certifier status (v1 safety valve)

**Integrity Controls**
- Rate limits: per certifier, per standard, per time window
- Monitoring: anomalous certifier–prover concentration may be excluded from leaderboards

# Embodied Coherence — 1-page Executive Memo (v0.2)
## Proof of Physical Work (PoPW)

> **Legend:** 🧾 Trial • 👤 Contender • 🧑‍⚖️ Marshal • 🏷️ Badge • ⛓️ On-chain • 🏆 Ladder • ✅ PASS • ⛔ NO PASS

### 🎯 What it is
PoPW is a shared 🧾 Trials and 🏷️ credential rail for physical tests. It issues non-transferable credentials for achievements verified by authorized 🧑‍⚖️ Marshals under versioned, immutable Trials.

### 🧭 Who it's for first
Partner gyms and coaches running grip + balance benchmarks where live observation is normal. Members pay for portable proof; gyms/coaches offer certified benchmarks as a session/event.

### 🔁 How it works (one Run)
1) 🧾 Select Trial (trialId, version) + tool matching spec
2) 👀 Perform Run under live observation (co-located or video)
3) ✍️ 👤 Contender + 🧑‍⚖️ Marshal co-sign one Record (2-of-2)
4) ⛓️ Submit ✅/⛔ outcome on-chain; ✅ PASS mints 🏷️ Badge
5) 🏆 Ladders rank verified ✅ PASS for Ladder-eligible Trial versions

### 🔗 Why blockchain
- Neutral registry of 🧾 Trial IDs + versions
- ⛓️ Publicly verifiable, non-repudiable Records (both parties signed)
- Portability across apps/communities via a shared credential graph
- Auditable history without reliance on one operator's database

### 🛡️ Integrity model (v1)
Integrity-first: permissioned 🧑‍⚖️ Marshals.
- Genesis Keys (multisig recommended) certify in Phase 1
- Expansion via 3 on-chain vouches
- Revocation safety valve in v1
- Rate limits + monitoring; 🏆 Ladder eligibility is curated while credentials persist

### 💸 Economics (illustrative)
- Run fee covers live labor (🧑‍⚖️ paid per Run)
- ✅ PASS mint fee funds issuance + Architect royalty (PASS only)
- Fees priced USD-equivalent; paid in protocol-approved assets

### ✅ Status
v1.0.16 protocol spec complete (registries + EIP-712 Records + integrity controls). Seed funds implementation, audit, mobile app, and Genesis pilots.

### 🤝 The ask
Seed to ship audited v1 and run 10–20 gym pilots with 20–50 active 🧑‍⚖️ Marshals, 5–10 🏆 Ladder-eligible 🧾 Trial versions, and 10k–50k Runs recorded.

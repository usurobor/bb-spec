# Embodied Coherence — 1-page Executive Memo (v0.3)
## Proof of Physical Work (PoPW)

> **Legend:** 🧾 Trial • 🧱 Spec • 👤 Contender • 🛡️ Marshal • 🏷️ Badge • 🎥 Replay • ⛓️ On-chain • 🏆 Ladder • ✅ PASS • ⛔ NO PASS

### 🎯 What it is
PoPW is a shared 🧾 Trials and 🏷️ credential rail for physical tests. It issues non-transferable credentials for achievements verified by authorized 🛡️ Marshals under versioned, immutable Trials, with a required 🎥 Replay for every minted 🏷️ Badge.

### 🧭 Who it's for first
Partner gyms and coaches running grip + balance benchmarks where live observation is normal. Members pay for portable proof; gyms/coaches offer certified benchmarks as a session/event.

### 🔁 How it works (one Run)
1) 🧾 Select Trial (trialId, version) + tool matching 🧱 spec
2) 🎥 Record the Run (required for ✅ PASS / 🏷️ Badge)
3) 👀 Perform Run under live observation (co-located or video)
4) ✍️ 👤 Contender + 🛡️ Marshal co-sign one Record (2-of-2)
5) ⛓️ Submit ✅/⛔ outcome on-chain; ✅ PASS mints 🏷️ Badge linked to 🎥 Replay
6) 🏆 Ladders rank verified ✅ PASS for Ladder-eligible Trial versions

### 🔗 Why blockchain
- Neutral registry of 🧾 Trial IDs + versions
- ⛓️ Publicly verifiable, non-repudiable Records (both parties signed)
- Portability across apps/communities via a shared credential graph
- Auditable history without reliance on one operator's database

### 🛡️ Integrity model (v1)
Integrity-first: permissioned 🛡️ Marshals.
- Genesis Keys (multisig recommended) certify in Phase 1
- Expansion via 3 on-chain vouches
- Revocation safety valve in v1
- Rate limits + monitoring; 🏆 Ladder eligibility is curated while credentials persist
- 🎥 Replay required for ✅ PASS / 🏷️ Badge (prevents missing-evidence claims)

### 💸 Economics (illustrative)
- Single base fee per Run (covers live labor + issuance)
- 🛡️ Marshal paid per Run (PASS or NO PASS)
- Architect royalty paid on ✅ PASS only; remainder to protocol ops
- Fees priced USD-equivalent; paid in protocol-approved assets

### ✅ Status
v1.0.17 protocol spec complete (registries + EIP-712 Records + integrity controls + 🎥 Replay requirement). Seed funds implementation, audit, mobile app, and Genesis pilots.

### 🤝 The ask
Seed to ship audited v1 and run 10–20 gym pilots with 20–50 active 🛡️ Marshals, 5–10 🏆 Ladder-eligible 🧾 Trial versions, and 10k–50k Runs recorded.

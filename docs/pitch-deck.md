# Embodied Coherence
## Proof-of-Physical-Work for the Onchain Era

---

## The Problem

**Physical achievements lack verifiable proof.**

- Certifications are siloed and centralized
- Credentials are easy to fake
- No universal standard for embodied mastery
- Lineages and traditions are fragmented

---

## The Solution

**Embodied Coherence: Decentralized certification for physical achievements.**

A protocol where:
- Trusted practitioners verify real-world feats under live observation
- Non-transferable tokens prove accomplishment
- Standards are versioned, immutable, and community-defined
- Trust propagates through vouching networks

---

## How It Works

```
1. Select Standard → 2. Perform Live → 3. Co-sign → 4. On-chain → 5. Leaderboard
```

1. **Prover** selects a Standard version and matching tool
2. **Prover** performs under live observation (co-located or video)
3. **Prover + Certifier** co-sign attestation (2-of-2)
4. **On-chain**: PASS mints BBT; NO PASS records attempt
5. **Leaderboards** rank verified PASS per Standard

## Key Primitives

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Standard** (id, version) | Tool spec, task, evidence requirements, pass rule, leaderboard rule |
| **Attestation** | 2-of-2 signed record with PASS / NO PASS result |
| **BBT** | Non-transferable Soul Bound Token (does not expire) |
| **$EC** | Fee and governance token |

---

## Market Opportunity

- **Fitness & Wellness**: $5.5T global market
- **Martial Arts**: 200M+ practitioners worldwide
- **Yoga**: 300M+ practitioners globally
- **Sports Credentials**: Fragmented, ripe for disruption

---

## Business Model

**Fee Distribution per Attempt:**

| Recipient | Share | When |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Certifier | 50-70% | Every attempt |
| Creator | 10-30% | PASS only |
| Protocol | 10-20% | Every attempt |

---

## Trust Model

### Genesis → Vouch → Monitor

1. **Genesis Keys**: Curated initial Certifiers; manage Certifier set
2. **3-Vouch Rule**: New Certifiers admitted after 3 on-chain vouches
3. **Revocation**: Genesis Keys can revoke (v1 safety valve)
4. **Rate Limits**: Per Certifier, per Standard, per time window
5. **Monitoring**: Anomalous Certifier–Prover concentration excluded from leaderboards

---

## Technical Highlights

- **EIP-712 Attestations**: Typed signatures with nonce, deadline, result
- **Versioned Standards**: Immutable once published; leaderboard eligibility flag
- **Privacy**: Media stays off-chain; attestations reference by hash
- **One PASS Rule**: One PASS per (prover, standardId, version)

---

## Traction & Roadmap

### Now (v1.0.16)
- Protocol specification complete
- Smart contracts implemented (Foundry)

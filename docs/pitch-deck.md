# Embodied Coherence
## Proof-of-Physical-Work for the Onchain Era

---

## The Problem

**Physical achievements lack verifiable proof.**

- Certifications are siloed and centralized
- Credentials are easy to fake
- No universal standard for embodied mastery
- Lineages and traditions are fragmented

---

## The Solution

**Embodied Coherence: Decentralized certification for physical achievements.**

A protocol where:
- Trusted practitioners verify real-world feats
- Non-transferable tokens prove accomplishment
- Standards are community-defined and open
- Trust propagates through vouching networks

---

## How It Works

```
Prover → Performs Feat → Certifier Verifies → BBT Minted
```

1. **Prover** selects a Standard (e.g., "1-minute sadhu board hold")
2. **Prover** performs the feat with evidence
3. **Certifier** reviews and co-signs attestation
4. **BBT** (Body Bound Token) minted as proof

## Key Primitives

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **BBT** | Non-transferable Soul Bound Token |
| **$EC** | Fee and governance token |
| **Standard** | JSON definition of achievement |
| **Attestation** | 2-of-2 signed proof |

---

## Market Opportunity

- **Fitness & Wellness**: $5.5T global market
- **Martial Arts**: 200M+ practitioners worldwide
- **Yoga**: 300M+ practitioners globally
- **Sports Credentials**: Fragmented, ripe for disruption

---

## Business Model

**Fee Distribution per Certification:**

| Recipient | Share |
|-----------|-------|
| Certifier | 50-70% |
| Creator (Standard author) | 10-30% |
| Protocol Treasury | 10-20% |

---

## Trust Model

### Genesis → Vouch Expansion

1. **Genesis Keys**: Curated initial Certifiers
2. **3-Vouch Rule**: New Certifiers need 3 existing vouches
3. **Reputation**: On-chain leaderboards track performance
